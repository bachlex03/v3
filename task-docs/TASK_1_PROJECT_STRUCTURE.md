# TASK_1_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

## 📋 Task Overview

**Task ID:** #1  
**Task Name:** Setup base project structure: assets folder (contain e.g. fonts, images,...)  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date Completed:** 2024-12-19  
**Time Spent:** Initial project setup

## 🎯 Task Description

Set up the fundamental project structure with proper folder organization, particularly focusing on assets management for fonts, images, and other static resources. This establishes the foundation for a scalable and maintainable codebase.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create organized folder structure
- [x] Set up assets folder for static resources
- [x] Establish proper file organization patterns
- [x] Prepare structure for fonts and images

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### What Was Built

- Basic React TypeScript project structure with Vite
- Assets folder organization for fonts, images, and static files
- Component structure foundation
- Proper file naming conventions

### How It Was Built

1. **Step 1:** Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project
2. **Step 2:** Create src folder structure with components, assets, etc.
3. **Step 3:** Set up assets folder with subfolders for different resource types
4. **Step 4:** Establish naming conventions and organization patterns

### Why This Approach

- **Reason 1:** Scalable folder structure that can grow with the project
- **Reason 2:** Clear separation of concerns (components, assets, utils, etc.)
- **Reason 3:** Industry standard React project organization
- **Alternative considered:** Flat structure was rejected for maintainability

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `src/assets/` - Main assets directory
- `src/components/` - React components directory
- `src/components/btn.tsx` - Initial button component
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

### Modified Files

- `index.html` - Updated with proper meta tags and title
- `src/main.tsx` - Application entry point
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application component

### Configuration Files

- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint configuration
- `tsconfig.app.json` - App-specific TypeScript config
- `tsconfig.node.json` - Node-specific TypeScript config

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices

- **Decision:** Use Vite as build tool instead of Create React App
- **Rationale:** Better performance, faster development server, modern tooling
- **Trade-offs:** Less opinionated setup requires more configuration

### Code Patterns Used

- Functional components with TypeScript
- Named exports for components
- PascalCase for component files
- Organized folder structure by feature type

### Dependencies Added/Updated

```json
{
  "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc": "^3.5.0",
  "react": "^18.3.1",
  "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
  "typescript": "~5.6.2",
  "vite": "^5.4.10"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Manual Testing Done

- [x] Project builds successfully with `yarn build`
- [x] Development server runs with `yarn dev`
- [x] TypeScript compilation works without errors
- [x] Assets folder structure is accessible

### Automated Tests

- Basic Vite test setup included
- ESLint configuration validates code quality
- TypeScript compiler checks type safety

### Performance Impact

- Bundle size: Minimal baseline (React + TypeScript)
- Load time: Fast with Vite's optimized development server
- Runtime performance: Excellent with React 18 features

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1

**Problem:** Choosing the right folder structure for scalability  
**Solution:** Adopted feature-based organization with clear separation  
**Learning:** Start simple but plan for growth from the beginning

### Challenge 2

**Problem:** Setting up proper TypeScript configuration  
**Solution:** Used Vite's TypeScript template with strict mode  
**Learning:** Strict TypeScript from start prevents future refactoring

## 🔗 Dependencies & Impact

### Tasks This Depends On

- None (foundational task)

### Tasks That Depend On This

- Task #2: Setup Tailwind CSS (requires project structure)
- Task #3: Set up project routing (requires component structure)
- Task #6: Set up CSS framework (requires assets organization)
- All future development tasks (require base structure)

### Side Effects

- Establishes coding standards and patterns
- Creates foundation for all future development
- Enables proper asset management and organization

## 📝 Code Examples

### Key Implementation

**Project Structure:**

```
src/
├── assets/          # Static assets
│   ├── fonts/       # Font files
│   ├── images/      # Image assets
│   └── icons/       # Icon assets
├── components/      # React components
│   └── btn.tsx      # Example component
├── App.tsx          # Main app component
└── main.tsx         # Entry point
```

### Usage Examples

```typescript
// Component organization pattern
import { Button } from './components/btn'

// Asset imports (future)
import logo from './assets/images/logo.png'
import customFont from './assets/fonts/custom.woff2'
```

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Add more specific asset subfolders as needed
- [ ] Implement proper asset optimization
- [ ] Set up asset loading patterns

### Long-term Considerations

- Consider asset bundling strategies
- Plan for internationalization folder structure
- Evaluate need for additional organization patterns

### Technical Debt

- No current technical debt
- Consider adding asset optimization tools
- May need to reorganize as project grows
