Here's how to prompt me effectively, Claude:

## �� **Effective Prompt Structure:**

### 1. **Be Clear and Specific**
```
❌ "Create a component"
✅ "Create a Button component with props: variant (primary/secondary), size (sm/md/lg), and onClick handler"
```

### 2. **Provide Full Context**
```
✅ "I'm building a React TypeScript portfolio, need a Hero section with:
- Background gradient
- Animated text typing effect
- CTA button
- Responsive design"
```

### 3. **Specify Desired Format**
```
✅ "Create TypeScript interface for User data including: name, email, role.
Return complete code with JSDoc comments"
```

## �� **Effective Prompt Types:**

### **For Coding:**
```
"Create [component name] with:
- Props: [list]
- Styling: [requirements]
- Behavior: [functionality]
- Accessibility: [requirements]"
```

### **For Debugging:**
```
"Error: [error description]
Current code: [paste code]
Expected: [desired result]
Environment: [React 18, TypeScript, etc.]"
```

### **For Optimization:**
```
"Optimize this component for performance:
- Bundle size
- Re-render optimization
- Loading speed
- SEO"
```

## 💡 **Key Tips:**

1. **One prompt = one task** - Don't combine multiple tasks
2. **Provide examples** - If possible
3. **Specify constraints** - "No external libraries"
4. **Request explanations** - "Explain why this approach"

```
